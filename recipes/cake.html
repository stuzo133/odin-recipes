    <p>
      This is a rich, moist white cake with great flavor, perfect for
      decorating. I made a double recipe and baked it in two 9" layer pans. I
      thought the amount of salt was extraordinary, so I cut it back by half and
      was pleased with the results. I frosted it with Decorator Frosting I, also
      from this site. I reserved some of the frosting and folded in strawberry
      preserves for a strawberry buttercream filling. Delicious, beautiful, and
      elegant cake
